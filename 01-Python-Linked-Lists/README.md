This is a revisiting of our first [example](../Review-01-Linked-Lists), but in Python! While
revisiting Linked Lists, in the context of Python 3, we will briefly discuss:

  - Iterators
  - Deep Copy
  - List Comprehensions
  - `@propery` and `@???.setter`
  - Name Mangling
  - `pydoc`

The recorded discussion is available [here](https://youtu.be/mtP36TTnuhs).
