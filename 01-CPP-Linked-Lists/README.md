During this Review, I discussed Linked Lists and addressed questions usually
received via email and during office hours.

  * **Example 1** was an implementation of Linked Lists similar to what one would
    see at the end of CS 250.
    * I briefly discussed command line arguments during this example.
    * The Linked List destructor was introduced in this example.
  * **Example 2** was a similar implementation, but with the Node struct moved
    within the scope of the Inventory class.
  * **Example 3** included a discussion of the Big-3.
    * This included a discussion of the LeakTracer utility.
  * **Example 4** covered the Copy-and-Swap Idiom.
    * I started with a brief review of how to explore an unfamiliar code.
    * I discussed the `-fsanitize` compilation flag and using the compiler to
      detect memory leaks.

This Review is split into four (3) recordings:

  - [Part 1 (in which I discuss Examples 1 & 2)](https://youtu.be/WwHUr1N2z7A).
  - [Part 2 (in which I discuss Example 3)](https://youtu.be/zuD8Oc4v22c).
  - [Part 3 (in which I discuss Example 4)](https://youtu.be/sBKR0KOG3fc).

Note that Example 5, will not be discussed in detail... yet.

Example 6 will cover Memory Pools as a topic of interest. Just like Example 5,
you are not required (or expected) to apply this material on Assignment 1.

  * **Example 5** is a preview of what we will have at the end of Review 03.
  * **Example 6** is a preview of what we will have at the end of Review 03.
