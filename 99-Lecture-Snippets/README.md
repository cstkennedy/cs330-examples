This is not a formal set of examples. Each piece of code comes from an informal
lecture discussion. 

  - `iterator-discussion` - brief demonstration of iterator use in C++
  - `word-stream-example` - demostration of the Java Stream API with an integer
    array (i.e., `int[]`).
  - `linked-list-no-branch` - example of how to build a linked list without
    conditional blocks
