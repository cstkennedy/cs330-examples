This discussion takes the iterator examples from Review 02 and incorporates the
Big-3 from Review 01 (to prevent memory leaks).

  - Examples 1 & 2 take the Linked List and Dynamic Array examples from Review
    02 and incorporate the Big-3, using the `Copy-and-Swap` implementation of
    the assignment operator.

  - Examples 3 through 5 cover how to generalize our code with: template
    tricks, and iterators.

  - Example 6 is *the fun part*.

The recorded review is split into three parts:

  1. [Part 1](https://youtu.be/inUskhq0SHo) - Examples 1 and 2.
  2. [Part 2](https://youtu.be/5-f_ej3cUJg) - Example 3 (review) through Example 5.
  2. [Part 3](https://youtu.be/s_1-4G8Gl4c) - Example 6.
