This discussion covers Linked Lists... starting with what is covered in CS 251.

  - **Example 1** was an implementation of Linked Lists similar to what one would
    see at the end of CS 251.

  - **Example 2** was a similar implementation, but with the `Node` class moved
    within the scope of the `LinkedList` class.

  - **Example 3** included a discussion of `Iterator`s.

The recorded lecture is split into two (2) parts:
