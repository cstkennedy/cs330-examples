# UML Class Diagrams

In CS 250, you built a semester project. You went through a fairly contrived process:

  1. Write the Test Plan using [Black-Box Testing](https://www.cs.odu.edu/~zeil/cs333/latest/Public/bbtesting)
  2. Write Pseudocode through [Stepwise Refinement and Top-Down Design](https://www.cs.odu.edu/~zeil/cs333/latest/Public/stepwise/)
  3. Take that Pseudocode, take some ADTs, throw them together and hope for the best.
    - Your approach was not quite so [blas√©](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/blas%C3%A9)
    - It was ineffective, unrefined, non-systematic, and backwards.
    - **We will start here...** after a whirlwind introduction to UML Class Diagrams.


# Whirlwind Introduction to UML Class Diagrams

One of the most difficult aspects of discussing object oriented code is
visualizing the pieces. To visualize classes and ADTs we can use UML Class
diagrams.

We will start by revisiting the C++ class checklist, mapping its parts into Java
and Python 3. We will then revisit Review 03 (Example 6) and build UML Class
diagrams with [PlantUML](http://plantuml.com/class-diagram).

The notes are available [here](https://www.cs.odu.edu/~tkennedy/cs330/latest/Public/classChecklistsAndPlantUML/).

# Proper Object Oriented Design and Analysis

The proper way to [**plan**](https://www.cs.odu.edu/~tkennedy/cs330/latest/Public/designDiscussion)
with objected oriented analysis.
